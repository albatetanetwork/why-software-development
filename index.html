      <p> 
        Math and Physics were my favorite subjects in school. I was more attracted from the science subjects and that's I decided to study for Engineering 12 years ago.
        I have completed my bachelor degree in Telecommunication Engineering and after few years I started my dream career in IT at Amazon and currently I am working as an IT Support Engineer.

      <h2>Why Software Development and why now?</h2>

      <p>After establishing a solid base in technology I am looking for the next step to improve my cureent skills and learn new ones. Since the early days in my carrer I realized that in order to succeed in my chosen tech carrer I need to continously learn, improve, innovate. 
         One of the most satisfying things in my current role has been developing my problem-solving skills, which will be tremendously helpful incorporating it to my SD Journey. However, in order to to increase the efficiency of my work and my team's daily work, programming is needed to be incorporated by making lots of repetitive tasks automated.
         Software Development will help me use the rescourses better and give the opportunity to the team to work on more exiting projects rather than spending lots of time working on very manual tasks where the risk to human error is much higher.

      <p>I am dedicated to learn how to code and even though it's gonna be quite a long process since I am starting from scratch.<br>
          Every direction I decide to take my career within IT, I know that having Software Development knowledge will be a big plus to help me succeed towards my next steps.</p>
